# Signature. Ad-hoc by default; set HXI_SIGN_ID to a Developer ID hash for a release build
# that can be notarised. Use the certificate *hash*, not its name -- there are two identical
# "Developer ID Application: Daniel Bates" certs in the login keychain and codesign rejects
# the name as ambiguous. Do NOT pass --timestamp here: it hangs on this network.
# Order matters, and the obvious order is wrong. x87sidecar_entitled needs its own entitlements
# (get-task-allow, cs.debugger) or it cannot attach to the game at all. Signing it *after* the
# app breaks the app's seal -- `codesign -v` then reports "a sealed resource is missing or
# invalid" and Gatekeeper rejects the bundle. So sign the nested binary FIRST, then sign the app
# WITHOUT --deep, which leaves nested signatures alone and seals them as they are.
#
# iCloud puts xattrs on everything it syncs and codesign refuses to sign a bundle carrying them
# ("resource fork, Finder information, or similar detritus not allowed"), so strip them first.
