# The Dock tile a running world wears

## The mechanism, from wine's source (2026-08-21)

No guessing needed — `dlls/winemac.drv` says exactly what it does:

    window.c:1234   pthread_once(&app_icon_once, set_app_icon);   // once, at first window creation
    window.c:795    set_app_icon()  -> create_app_icon_images()
    image.c:250     create_app_icon_images() -> KeUserDispatchCallback(app_icon_callback)
    dllmain.c:255   macdrv_app_icon() -> EnumResourceNamesW(NULL, RT_GROUP_ICON, get_first_resource, ...)

So the Dock tile is **the first `RT_GROUP_ICON` resource of the running .exe**, read once, when the
first window appears. That settles three things at once:

* `WM_SETICON` can never move it (window icons are a different thing entirely), which is why the
  addon's attempt logged success and changed nothing.
* No addon can fix it either: the icon is latched before any Lua runs.
* `exeIcon.icns` is a CrossOver-ism, not this path.

And the reason FFXI in particular gets a generic tile:

    $ wrestool -l bootloader/horizon-loader.exe
    --type=16 ... [type=version]
    --type=24 ... [manifest]

**`horizon-loader.exe` carries no icon resource at all.** wine logs "found no RT_GROUP_ICON
resource" and falls back to its own tile. The game is not being denied its icon; it has none.

## What was built, and where it stopped

`tools/icon-into-exe.c` (i686-mingw, runs under wine) adds an .ico to an exe through Windows' own
`BeginUpdateResource`/`UpdateResource`/`EndUpdateResource`, so there is no hand-rolled PE surgery.
It works: six icon images plus the group directory land in a **copy** of the loader, `wrestool`
lists them, and the patched copy behaves identically standalone (byte-identical `--help` output).

    ./scripts/theme-loader.sh     # builds the tool, patches a copy, leaves the original alone

**Ashita will not boot the patched copy.** The injector prints its banner and then nothing — no
injection, no login, no window — both when the copy is renamed (`horizon-loader-ffxi.exe`) and when
it keeps the original name in a sibling folder (`bootloader-ffxi/horizon-loader.exe`). The exe
itself is fine, so something in the Ashita/loader boot chain rejects a modified binary.

## 2026-08-25: two of the three routes are now closed, with evidence

### Why Ashita will not boot the icon-patched loader — answered

`horizon-loader.exe` has **`.detourc` and `.detourd` sections**: it is a Detours-based injector.
`UpdateResource` grows `.rsrc`, and that moves everything after it:

| | original | patched |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.rsrc` vsize | `0x418` | `0x12000` |
| `.reloc` vaddr | `0xFD000` | **`0x10E000`** |
| SizeOfImage | `0x107000` | **`0x118000`** |
| PE checksum | `0x104B8D` | **`0x104B8D`** (not recomputed) |

So the image grew and `.reloc` moved while the Detours payload still describes the old layout and
the checksum is stale. That is the "banner, then silence". Making it work would mean rewriting
HorizonXI's Detours payload inside their binary -- fragile, and on their server a modification of
their own executable, which their rules prohibit. **This route is closed.**

### Wrapping wine in a .app bundle — tested, does not work

The idea: put the wine loader in `FFXI.app/Contents/MacOS/wine`, symlink the lib tree at
`Contents/lib` (wine finds it as `../lib`), give the bundle an `.icns`, and let macOS hand the
process the bundle's tile. The bundle runs the game correctly -- but the Dock tile stays generic,
because **the process that owns the window is not the binary that was launched**: wine re-execs
each Windows process from its own install directory. The running client's image path is
`/Volumes/.../wine`, not the bundle. Setting `WINELOADER` into the bundle does not redirect it
either; this wine derives its loader from the install dir.

### No configuration knob exists

`strings` on `lib/wine/i386-windows/winemac.drv` shows the `EnumResourceNamesW` /
`CreateIconFromResourceEx` / `GRPICONDIR` path and **no registry key** for an app icon. There is
nothing to set.

### What is left

Patch `winemac.drv` so `macdrv_app_icon()` falls back to an icon named by an environment
variable, then set it per world. It is a small change and it is also the only route that is clean
on the rules front -- wine is the runtime, not an Ashita addon, so it touches nothing of the
server's. The cost is entirely the build: there is no wine source tree here, `wine-coop` is a
prebuilt from `athei/wine-build`, so this needs a CrossOver-wine source build stood up first.

**Next**, in the order worth trying:

1. Find out what rejects it. Ashita's own log for those runs is the place to look — if the loader
   is hashed or signature-checked, this pathway is closed and step 2 is the answer.
2. **Patch winemac.drv instead of the game.** `wine-coop` is this project's own wine build, and a
   small patch there could read the app name *and* icon from environment variables — fixing the
   generic tile and the "wine" in Cmd-Tab together, for every world, without touching a single
   third-party binary. It needs a wine source build, which is the real cost.
3. Check whether `pol.exe` / `xiloader.exe` in the same folder already carry icons and whether
   Horizon accepts being booted through one of them.

Goal: every game launch shows an FFXI-themed tile instead of a generic one.

**Status: partly done.** The launcher's own tile is this project's crystal. The *game's* tile is
still generic. What follows is what was tried, with the result, so the next attempt starts from
evidence rather than from scratch.

## Where a wine process's tile actually comes from

Not from the wrapper. Three things were measured on 2026-08-21:

1. **The wrapper's Info.plist does not decide it.** `siku.app` was restamped (its `AppIcon.icns`
   replaced with ours, `CFBundleName` set to "FFXI — HorizonXI"), and a wine process started from
   `siku.app/Contents/SharedSupport/wine/bin/wine` still showed as `wine` with wine's own tile.
2. **The window's Win32 icon does decide it — at window creation.** A wine Notepad shows a
   *Notepad* tile, so macdrv is reading the program's icon. Sending `WM_SETICON` afterwards (from
   `mousediag`, with an .ico this project generates) is accepted and logged, but the Dock tile
   does not change. The read looks like a one-shot at window creation.
3. **Running wine from inside our own .app bundle breaks wine.** Both a symlink and a hard link
   to the wine binary inside `Foo.app/Contents/MacOS/` fail: the symlink dies with
   "macdrv_init Failed to start Cocoa app main loop", and the hard link (and a plain copy) with
   "Your wine binary was not upgraded correctly". This wine resolves its own install root from
   its executable path, so it cannot be relocated into a bundle.

## What is in the tree

* `scripts/make_game_icon.py` -> `app/GameIcon.icns` — the gold variant of the launcher's crystal
  (this project's own art), so a running world reads differently from the launcher at a glance.
* `DockIcon.swift` — stamps the wine wrapper with that icon and the world's name before each
  launch, keeping the original as `AppIcon.original.icns`. Harmless and reversible
  (`DockIcon.restore`), and correct the day a launch goes through the wrapper app — but by
  finding (1) it is not what the Dock reads today.
* `addons/mousediag/ffxi-dock.ico` + the `WM_SETICON` call in `mousediag.lua` — sets the client
  window's icon. Verified to run ("dock icon: set from …"), not yet verified to move the tile.

## Also ruled out 2026-08-21 (second round)

4. **A real .app bundle around wine does not rename it either.** With `Contents/lib` and
   `Contents/share` symlinked to the wine tree, wine runs fine from inside a bundle named
   `HorizonXI.app` with our icon and `CFBundleName` — and Cmd-Tab still says **wine**, because
   winemac.so registers the Cocoa application itself. Setting `WINELOADER` to the in-bundle path
   changes nothing.
5. **`exeIcon.icns` next to the .exe is not read.** The name appears in winemac.so's strings
   alongside `create_app_icon_images` / `setApplicationIconImage:`, so this build does have a
   file-based icon path, but dropping `exeIcon.icns` in `C:\windows\system32` beside notepad.exe
   left the tile as wine's derived exe icon. The location it actually reads has not been found;
   the string is worth chasing with a disassembler rather than by guessing paths.

## What to try next, in order

1. **Set the icon before the first window exists.** `WM_SETICON` after the fact appears to be too
   late. An Ashita *plugin* (or `winefix`, which already loads first) could set the icon class
   for `FFXiClass` via `SetClassLongPtr(GCLP_HICON)` before the window is created, which is the
   handle macdrv would read at creation.
2. **Launch through the wrapper's own launcher.** Wineskin wrappers own the Dock tile through
   `siku.app/Contents/MacOS/wineskinlauncher`; a launch that goes through it would inherit the
   wrapper identity this project already stamps. The reason we do not is the launch-death work
   (docs/LAUNCH-DEATH.md): the game is spawned through a shell deliberately. Worth re-testing now
   that `spawnViaShell` is understood.
3. **Accept a per-world tile name only.** Even without the icon, giving the spawned shell a name
   ("HorizonXI" rather than `exec`) makes the Dock legible. Cheap, and independent of 1 and 2.

## 2026-08-26: SOLVED — CX_ROOT icon fallback, no wine rebuild needed

The winemac.drv patch route (above) turned out to be unnecessary. Reading
`set_app_icon()` in the CX wine source (athei/wine `cx-26-patched`,
`dlls/winemac.drv/window.c:832`) shows CrossOver Hack 13440 already provides an
env-driven fallback:

* when the exe has **no** RT_GROUP_ICON resource, `create_app_icon_images()`
  returns NULL, and wine loads `$CX_ROOT/../../Resources/exeIcon.icns` instead.
* `horizon-loader.exe` has no icon resource, so it always takes this path.

So the fix is just to point `CX_ROOT` at a bundle-shaped folder that holds our
icon at `Contents/Resources/exeIcon.icns` (two levels up from CX_ROOT). No wine
build, no touching the server's binary.

**Verified 2026-08-26.** An icon-less test exe run under `wine-coop` with
`CX_ROOT` set showed the gold crystal tile in the Dock (running dot beneath it),
and a live `horizon-loader.exe` launch through the launcher showed the same gold
crystal. See `DockIcon.cxRoot()` (builds the folder under Application Support and
returns the CX_ROOT path) and `Runner.launchClient` (sets `env["CX_ROOT"]`).

CX_ROOT is otherwise read only by `localspl` (ps2pdf, printing) and the
round-rect icon mask PNG — which this project deliberately does not ship, so the
crystal is drawn as-is.
