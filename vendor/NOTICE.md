# vendor — third-party binaries

Redistributed so the Metal renderer and x87 acceleration work without a build on the user's Mac.
All are freely redistributable. Local modifications are listed below and in `../patches/README.md`.

## dxvk-1.10.3-x32-d3d9-horizonxi.dll

This is DXVK 1.10.3 with the cumulative HorizonXI and exact readback-fence patches, the
MoltenVK upload-buffer prefault, the NX enforcement that removes the scene-load stall under
Rosetta, and the opt-in diagnostic probes listed in `../patches/README.md`. The prefault and NX
enforcement are active in normal play. The probes do nothing unless the launcher arms a
performance capture. SHA-256 `5164ce8dae9f1defaf03c6bfad67779944884854be5df4b01da1c7519371e9b6`,
built 2026-09-03 from the patch stack in `../patches/README.md`, which was verified to reproduce
the build tree exactly.

## mtld3d

The production build includes the FFXI material fallback and unaligned buffer-lock fixes,
diagnostic probes, optional independent render-pass merging, and reuse of identical generated
shader code across rendering states. The shader reuse change preserves schema 68 and existing
warmed caches. It is a modified upstream
build. `mtld3d/build.json` records the base commit and every runtime file's SHA-256;
`mtld3d/source.patch` records the complete source diff used to build it. The renderer selector
enables pass merging and keeps early submission disabled. The Wine shim, Unix library and
both prefix markers must accompany the native D3D9 DLL. See `../docs/MTLD3D-EXPERIMENTS.md`.

## x87sidecar-coop

This is the unentitled cooperative binary used by the patched Wine runtime: upstream `4e9c738`
plus `../patches/x87sidecar-profile-pid-path.patch`, which expands `%p` in both `X87_SAMPLE` and
`X87_PROFILE` to the profiled target's PID. The launcher needs this because its injector and game
processes inherit one output path but run in separate sidecars. SHA-256
`81185d42b73a0390712d8cc9d99f5bc9416fb4b31ffdaf7efb26b9675fbd3ad6`. Upstream `4e9c738` carries
the FMA-contraction default, the block-restart cache reset, and async-signal survival that removed
the earlier `FFXiMain.dll+0x3d638` geometry stall. The sticky-sampler patch has not been ported
to this commit. The local patch affects diagnostics only.

## x87sidecar_entitled

Patches Rosetta 2's x87 emulation with a native ARM64 JIT — FFXI's 32-bit client runs its
floating-point math through x87, which Rosetta emulates at roughly 1% of native speed (see
`docs/X87-WALL.md`); this is the fix, worth 11.3→28.5 fps in-world at max settings. Built from
source with one local patch, `../patches/x87sidecar-attach-pid.patch`, adding an `--attach <pid>`
mode: without it the sidecar can only patch a process it launches itself, but Ashita runs the
actual game in a child process (`horizon-loader.exe`) that a launch-time wrap never reaches.

Built with the `get-task-allow` and `com.apple.security.cs.debugger` entitlements
(`x87sidecar-entitlements.plist`) required to attach to another process at all. `bundle.sh`
re-signs it individually with that plist *after* the app's own deep-sign, which otherwise
overwrites it with the app's entitlements (none) and silently breaks attaching.

**Why these exact versions.** DXVK 2.x and 3.x require Vulkan 1.3 and the `geometryShader`
feature. Metal has no geometry shaders, so MoltenVK can never expose one and those releases can
never run on Apple Silicon — 3.0.2 loads, enumerates the M1, and rejects it. 1.10.3 predates that
requirement. Gcenx's macOS repack of 1.10.3 omits `d3d9.dll` entirely, so it has to come from
doitsujin's release.

## dxvk-1.10.3-x32-d3d9-nofog.dll

DXVK 1.10.3 (doitsujin/dxvk, zlib/libpng licence), built here from the v1.10.3 tag with two
patches in `../patches/`:

* `dxvk-1.10.3-build-gcc14.patch` — build fixes only. GCC 14 / mingw-w64 14 no longer include
  `<cstdint>` transitively, and mingw now defines `_D3DDEVINFO_RESOURCEMANAGER` itself, so DXVK's
  old workaround became a redefinition.
* `dxvk-1.10.3-ffp-fog.patch` — the functional change. Fixed-function fog is bypassed, because it
  reads `render_state_t`, the uniform block MoltenVK mis-binds on Metal. See docs/PATHWAYS.md.

Build: `meson setup --cross-file build-win32.txt --buildtype release builddir32 &&
ninja -C builddir32 src/d3d9/d3d9.dll`, then `i686-w64-mingw32-strip -s`.

The unpatched `dxvk-1.10.3-x32-d3d9.dll` is kept beside it for comparison.
